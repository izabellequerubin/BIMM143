## 1. Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

```{r}
pdb_data <- read.csv("MolecType.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, row.names = 1)
pdb_data$X.ray <- gsub(",", "", pdb_data$X.ray)
pdb_data$EM <- gsub(",", "", pdb_data$EM)
pdb_data$NMR <- gsub(",", "", pdb_data$NMR)
pdb_data$Total <- gsub(",", "", pdb_data$Total)
head(pdb_data)
```

**Q1:** What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
pdb_data$X.ray <- as.integer(pdb_data$X.ray)
pdb_data$EM <- as.integer(pdb_data$EM)
pdb_data$NMR <- as.integer(pdb_data$NMR)
pdb_data$Total <- as.integer(pdb_data$Total)
head(pdb_data)
```

```{r}
percent_xray <- sum(pdb_data$X.ray, pdb_data$EM, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(pdb_data$Total) * 100
percent_xray
```

93% of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

**Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
sum(pdb_data$Total[1], pdb_data$Total[2], pdb_data$Total[3]) / sum(pdb_data$Total)
```

The proportion of structures in the PDB are protein is 0.98.

**Q3:** Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 2,067 HIV-1 protease structures in the current PDB.

## 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

**Q4:** Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

In this structure, we see only one atom per water molecule due to the PDB format. As a way to conserve space and reduce the size of PDB files, water molecules are only represented by one atom.

**Q5:** There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

HOH 308

**Q6:** Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
```

```{r}
pdb
```

**Q7:** How many amino acids residues are there in this pdb object?

198

**Q8:** Name one of the two non-protein residues.

HOH

**Q9.** How many protein chains are in this structure?

2

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

### Predicting functional motions of a single structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

```{r}
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexibility prediction
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```
